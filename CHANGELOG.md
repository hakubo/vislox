# Changelog

vislox follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). Release tags are `vX.Y.Z`; the Docker image is
published under the same version (see [docker/README.md](docker/README.md)).

## Unreleased

## 0.2.0

- Which config the Miniserver runs: the program file it loaded, from `def.log` and `/prog`, under the History
  title, with warnings for an upload still waiting (`sps_new.zip`), the emergency config (`Emergency.LoxCC`),
  and a newest file the Miniserver skipped or does not run (#28).
- Apply verifies by load: after the program restart, `sps_new.zip` must be gone and `def.log` must show it was
  loaded. Otherwise Apply says "Applied, but not verified" and why (#28).
- vislox has a version: `vislox --version` and the UI show it with the commit it was built from. A release tag
  must match `Cargo.toml`.

## 0.1.0

The first version, before releases were tagged: the Loxone Config-style viewer with history, change review,
Pull from Miniserver, live values, Change with AI, Apply, Sync and Discard, and the Docker image.
